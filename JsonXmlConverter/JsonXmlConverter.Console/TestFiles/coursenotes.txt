Rita F. Pierson
Every kid needs a champion
Rita Pierson, a teacher for 40 years, once heard a colleague say, "They don't pay me to like the kids." 
Her response: "Kids don't learn from people they don't like.'" A rousing call to educators to believe
 in their students and actually connect with them on a real, human, personal level.

Christopher Emdin
Teach teachers how to create magic
What do rap shows, barbershop banter and Sunday services have in common? As Christopher Emdin says, they 
all hold the secret magic to enthrall and teach at the same time — and it's a skill we often don't teach
 to educators. A longtime teacher himself, now a science advocate and cofounder of Science Genius
  B.A.T.T.L.E.S. with the GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan, Emdin offers a vision to make the classroom come alive.

Linda Cliatt-Wayman
How to fix a broken school? Lead fearlessly, love hard
On Linda Cliatt-Wayman's first day as principal at a failing high school in North Philadelphia, she was
 determined to lay down the law. But she soon realized the job was more complex than she thought. With
  palpable passion, she shares the three principles that helped her turn around three schools labeled 
  "low-performing and persistently dangerous." Her fearless determination to lead — and to love the 
  students, no matter what — is a model for leaders in all fields.

Tyler DeWitt
Hey science teachers -- make it fun
High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about his new lesson plan on bacteria (how cool!) 
— and devastated when his students hated it. The problem was the textbook: it was impossible to understand. 
He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision, and instead make 
science sing through stories and demonstrations.
